// Express is built upon the HTTP between client and server

// ** RESTful Services **
// REST => Representational State Transfer
// RESTful applications use HTTP requests to provide support to create, read, update, and delete data (CRUD operations)
// Common HTTP methods - GET: for getting data, POST: for creating data, PUT: for updating data, DELETE: for deleting data
// (Request, Response) => e.g. (GET /api/customers), ( [{id: 1, name: ''}, {id: 2, name: ''}, ...] )
